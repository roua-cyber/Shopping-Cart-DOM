# Shopping Cart (javascript and DOM manipulation ) 

For this project , i created a shopping cart.

In this scenario, it’s a cart in which items have already been preselected,

the user is able to apply the following instructions.

* Adjust the quantity of each item through  “+” and “-” buttons.

* Delete items from the cart.

* Like items through a clickable heart-shaped button that will change color accordingly.

* See the total price adjusted according to quantity and deletions.
